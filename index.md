# About Me

Hi! I am Wenshuo Wang, a Postdoctoral Fellow supported by [IVADO Awards](https://ivado.ca/en/spotlight-on-our-academic-community/?programmes=postdoctoral-research-funding) at the [Smart Transportation Lab](https://lijunsun.github.io/), McGill University, collaborating with [Dr. Lijun Sun](https://www.mcgill.ca/civil/lijun-sun). I received my Ph.D. degree in Mechanical Engineering from Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China in 2018. Prior to joining McGill, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow with [UC Berkeley](https://path.berkeley.edu/) (2019/10-2020/10) and [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/) (2018/07-2019/10). During my Ph.D. program, I was a Research Assistant working with [Prof. J. Karl Hedrick](https://www.vehicle.me.berkeley.edu/) at Vehicle Dynamics & Control Lab (VDL), UC Berkeley (2015/09-2017/09) and with [Dr. Ding Zhao](https://safeai-lab.github.io/) and [Prof. Xuanlong Nguyen](http://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~xuanlong/)(Dept. of Statistics) at UMTRI, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (2017-2018). My research interests are Bayesian nonparametric learning and reinforcement learning, and their applications to multi-agent interaction behavior modeling and prediction in common-but-challenging situations for smart mobility.

# Research
My research **goal** is to develop analytically computable tools to semantically understand and predict human-involved interaction behaviors using data science and machine learning techniques, toward eco-safe deployments of artifical intelligent agents (e.g., autonomous cars) in the human cyber-physical systems (H-CPS), especially in Smart Cities.

My research **interests** mainly focus on Cognitive Autonomy & Learning (CAL) --- combining human behavior analysis and prediction from insights of cognitive science with machine learning & AI techniques, as well as data science, to enable mobile robotic systems (e.g. intelligent vehicles) to reason competently about their own safety, thus making H-CPS more safe and smarter, including:

* Human behavior modeling and prediction, Cognition & perception, Human-robot interaction 
* Intelligent transportation, Autonomous driving, Multi-agent interaction, Advanced driver assistance systems 
* Bayesian statistics & machine learning, Stocastic processes, (Inverse) Reinforcement learning and optimal control
