| Natural Dataset of Driving Style (To be released in June 2023) | Around 2 TB | _Driving style tags_: Each driver's subjective driving style is provided as a valid benchmark for driving style analysis and algorithm development. _Long recording of individual drivers_: 100 drivers with different driving experiences were covered, with the average driving time per driver being more than 30 minutes, ensuring the sufficiency and diversity of the dataset. _Unified testing route_: The driving route is unified to avoid the influence of different routes on driving style. _Operation information_: Complete manipulation data was collected, such as vehicle speed, gas pedal, opening rate of gas pedal, steering wheel angle, steering wheel speed, etc., which can promote the algorithm development of driving styles to the control layer.| 100 drivers were recuited and their information was investigated about gender, ages, driving experience occupies, driving styles. The driving operation, GPS and videos were recorded by the vehicle mounted a data-acquisition system.  |
