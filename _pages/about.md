Hi! I am a **Postdoctoral Fellow** supported by [IVADO Fellowship Awards](https://ivado.ca/en/spotlight-on-our-academic-community/?programmes=postdoctoral-research-funding) at the [McGill University](https://lijunsun.github.io/) with [Lijun Sun](https://www.mcgill.ca/civil/lijun-sun). I am also fortunate to work with [J. Karl Hedrick](https://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/in-memoriam/files/karl-hedrick.html), [Changliu Liu](http://icontrol.ri.cmu.edu/), [Xuanlong Nguyen](http://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~xuanlong/), and [Ding Zhao](https://safeai-lab.github.io/). I received my Ph.D. degree in Mechanical Engineering from Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China in 2018. Prior to joining McGill, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow with [UC Berkeley, DeepDrive](https://deepdrive.berkeley.edu/) and [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/). From 2015-2017, I was a Research Assistant working with J. Karl Hedrick at UC Berkeley and Ding Zhao and Xuanlong Nguyen at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. My research interests are Bayesian nonparametric learning and reinforcement learning, and their applications to multi-agent interaction behavior modeling and prediction in common-but-challenging situations for smart mobility.


My research *goal* is to develop analytically computable tools to semantically understand and predict human-involved interactions using machine learning techniques with support of data science toward eco-safe deployment of AI-based agents (e.g., autonomous cars) in the human cyber-physical systems (H-CPS) such as Smart Cities.

My research *interests* mainly focus on **Cognitive Autonomy & Interactive Learning (CAIL)** --- combining human interactive behavior analysis and prediction from insights of computational cognition with machine learning & AI techniques to enable mobile robotic systems (e.g. intelligent vehicles) to reason competently about their own safety, thus making H-CPS more safe and smarter, including:

* Interaction behavior modeling and prediction, Cognition & perception, Human-robot interaction 
* Intelligent transportation, Autonomous driving, Multi-agent interaction, Advanced driver assistance systems 
* Bayesian statistics & machine learning, Stocastic processes, (Inverse) Reinforcement learning and optimal control
