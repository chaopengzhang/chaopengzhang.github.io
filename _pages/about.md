Hi! I am a visiting researcher in [GVLab](http://www.gvlab.jp/) at [The University of Tokyo (UTokyo)](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/), collaborating with Prof. [Gentiane Venture](http://www.gvlab.jp/gv/index.html). I am also currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering under the supervision of Prof. Junqiang Xi in [Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT)](https://me-english.bit.edu.cn/), China. I received the B.S. degree from BIT in 2019. I am also fortunate to work with Prof. [Wenshuo Wang](https://wenshuowang.github.io/). My research interest lies on understanding **human driving behavior** when interacting with an autonomous vehicle and other agents in traffic toward human-centered vehicles. My research goal is to develop a computationally efficient and interpretable way to understand and recognize the human **driving style** and **driving intention** to facilitate the development of **human-centered intelligent vehicles**.
